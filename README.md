# PFRPG Item Durability
This extension adds hardness, hitpoints, and damage boxes to item sheets.
Damage rolled can be dragged to the item damage field to have hardness subtracted and the damaged added to the previous field contents.
If the damage is energy damage, it is divided in half before removing hardness.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with FantasyGrounds Classic 3.3.11 and FantasyGrounds Unity 4.0.0 (2020-07-16).
It's not compatible with rmilmine's [Advanced Character Inventory Manager](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?57819-Advanced-Character-Iventory-Manager-for-3-5E-and-Pathfinder) or [Customised Item Generator](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?57818-Customized-Item-Generator-for-3-5E-and-Pathfinder). It's not compatible with any other extension that replaced item_main.lua. This may change in the future, but for now I wouldn't recommend mixing and matching these.

# Features
* Simplifies tracking hitpoints of weapons, armor, and equipment.
* Provides visual indication of item damage by color coding the number proportionately to damage.
